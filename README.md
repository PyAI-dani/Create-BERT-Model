# create your BERT model from scratch with pytorch

I write the structure of BERT model from scratch by pytorch
you can train your model on your own dataset

+ you can change the structure of the model without any error!
+ for example you can change the number of neuron for train it on your laptop without good GPUs or CPU!

in the next version i decide for create a good enviroment for chat with the model and train it simple!

please give a star to my project for create next version fasterðŸ˜‰
